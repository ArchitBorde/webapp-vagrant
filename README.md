# Automating the Provisioning of a Web Application with Vagrant and VProfile

## Introduction

This project is a web application that uses a variety of technologies including Nginx for load balancing, Apache Tomcat server for application hosting, RabbitMQ for message queuing, Memcached for caching, and MySQL as a database. The purpose of this project is to automate the provisioning of this web application using Vagrant and VProfile.

By using VProfile, we can define the configuration of these technologies in simple YAML files, and then use Vagrant to create and provision the virtual machines needed to host the web application. This allows us to easily create and manage complex virtual machine environments for development, testing, and other purposes, while adhering to the principles of Infrastructure as Code (IAC).

## Installation

To use this project, you will need to have the following tools installed:

- Vagrant (version 2.2.14 or higher)
- VirtualBox (version 6.1 or higher)
- VProfile (version 0.3.1 or higher)

Once you have these tools installed, you can clone the project repository and run the following command to create and provision the virtual machines:

$ vagrant up


This will use the VProfile configuration files in the `/vagrant` directory to create and provision the virtual machines.

## Usage

Once the virtual machines are provisioned, you can access the web application using the following URL:

http://localhost:8080


This will load balance the web application across the Apache Tomcat servers and use Memcached for caching.

To access the RabbitMQ management console, use the following URL:

http://localhost:15672


This will allow you to monitor the queues and message rates.

You can also customize the virtual machine configuration by editing the VProfile configuration files in the `/vagrant` directory. For example, you can change the amount of RAM or CPU cores allocated to the virtual machines, or add additional network interfaces.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this project, you can fork the repository on GitHub and submit pull requests with your changes. Please ensure that your code follows the project's coding conventions and is thoroughly tested.

## Technologies Used

- Vagrant: a tool for creating and managing virtual machine environments
- VProfile: a tool for defining and managing virtual machine configurations
- Nginx: a high-performance web server and reverse proxy server
- Apache Tomcat: an open-source Java Servlet container and web server
- RabbitMQ: a message queuing software
- Memcached: a distributed memory caching system
- MySQL: an open-source relational database management system
- YAML: a human-readable data serialization format used for defining VProfile configurations
- Shell script: a scripting language used for executing commands on the virtual machine

## Features

- Declarative configuration management: define virtual machine configurations in simple YAML files
- Automated provisioning: spin up and provision virtual machines with a single command
- Customizable configurations: define your own resources, network settings, and other configuration options
- Scalable: uses Nginx for load balancing to support high-traffic environments
- Infrastructure as Code: the entire infrastructure is defined in code, allowing for easy management, version control, and reproducibility
